Edoc is an e-channeling web project using PHP, HTML, and CSS to facilitate online appointment requests for medical establishments. It helps doctors manage appointments with patients and organizes schedules for each patient. The system comprises three roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. The admin populates a list of doctors with their specialties and credentials. Patients can browse the website to find a doctor with their specialty, review their schedule, and submit an appointment request. Doctors can view appointments and patient requests for availability.
